# StreamKM
Modifications to the StreamKM algorithm implemented in MOA 16.04.

The StreamKM++ algorithm is described by Ackermann et al. in their paper "" [1].

MOA (Massive Online Analysis) [2] is a Java-based, open source framework for data stream mining. More details can be found on its [website](http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) and it can be found on GitHub as well (https://github.com/waikato/moa).
